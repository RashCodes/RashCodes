I'm a passionate software developer specializing in front-end development.

Nearly 2 years of valuable experience, including self-learning as a front-end developer, have passed for me. I've developed my knowledge and skills in several frontend development-related areas over the past few years, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJs, Redux, Integration APIs XML-Data & JSON, Material UI, Bootstrap5, and responsive design. Since I believe in lifelong learning and development in this quickly evolving field, I am passionate about staying up to date with the latest front-end technologies and best practices.
